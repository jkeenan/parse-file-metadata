README for Parse-File-Metadata

NAME
    Parse::File::Metadata - For plain-text files that contain both metadata
    and data records, parse metadata first

DESCRIPTION
    This module is useful when you have to parse a plain-text file that
    meets the following conditions:

    *   The file consists of two types of records:

        *   A header section consisting of key-value pairs which
            constitute, in some sense, metadata.

        *   A body section consisting mainly or entirely of data
            records, which may be either delimited or fixed-width.

        *   The header and the body are separated by one or more empty
            records.

    *   Your program must parse the metadata first, then make a decision on
        the basis of the metadata whether to proceed with parsing of the
        data. The metadata may or may not be used in the parsing of the
        data.

    *   Call 'perldoc lib/Parse/File/Metadata.pm' for further documentation.
